# Visualizations of Marriage and Family Formation Data Within 2020 Decennial Census

Note: these analyses are limited to regions with at least 100 relevant households. For instance, maps and tables that show the percentage of households aged 35-64 who are married show only those areas with at least 100 householders aged 35-64; similarly, maps that show the percentage of households with kids that are led by married couples show only those areas with at least 100 households with kids.

## Categorical maps

These maps group regions into four different categories: *Deserts*, *Lower share* areas, *Higher share* areas, and *Oases.* These categories are based on percentiles for tracts with at least 100 residents.

Note: some of these regions do not have all four areas represented. In this case, the color scales won't match those of regions in which all four areas *are* represented.

[*Note: I also created gradient maps that show the percentage of adults aged 15-34, 35-64, and 15-64 who are married; however, I removed them from this site in order to stay within GitHub's file size limitations.*]
